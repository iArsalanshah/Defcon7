## Original User Request:
Create a responsive web application named 'Defcon7' with four main pages: Home, Leaderboard, Call Alerts, and Tutorials.

The Home page should have a hero section with a CTA to join our Discord server, a section showing the top 3 most recent memecoin calls (Coin Name, % Gain, Caller), and an About section describing Defcon7.

Add a featured section titled ‘Meet the Team’ showing important community members:

Ghost – Expert at finding promising memecoins and making top calls.

CoachCrypto – Admin who handles community operations and creates helpful YouTube tutorials for new traders.

The Leaderboard page should display top traders with filter options for Daily, Weekly, and All Time. Show columns like Rank, Trader Name, Total Calls, Average Gain %, and Badges.

The Call Alerts page should include a searchable, filterable list of recent calls with Coin Name, % Gain, Caller Name, and Timestamp.

The Tutorials page should show a curated list of important YouTube videos for beginner traders. Each entry should have a thumbnail, title, and short description. Include videos such as 'How to trade Solana memecoins' and 'How to use the GMGN bot for trading.'

The overall design should be modern, crypto-themed, and mobile-responsive, with potential to scale into a Flutter mobile app in the future.
